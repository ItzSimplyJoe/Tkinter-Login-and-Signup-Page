###### This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for a sign-up and login system built using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides a fully functional login and registration system, complete with validation and error handling.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

This project also requires the following Python modules:

 - Tkinter
 - CustomTkinter
 - PIL
 - Random
 - OS
These modules are included with most Python installations, so you shouldn't need to install them separately.

## Usage
To run the application, simply execute the main.py file in your Python interpreter:

python `main.py`
This will open the main window of the application, where you can choose to either sign up or login.

When signing up, you will need to provide a username and password, which will be stored in a local file. The application will validate the input fields and display an error message if the data is invalid.

When logging in, you will need to provide the username and password that you used when signing up. The application will validate the input fields and check if the provided credentials match the ones stored in the file. If the credentials are correct, the user will be logged in and directed to the main dashboard.

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet functional sign-up and login system built with Tkinter in Python. You can use this project as a starting point for building more complex applications that require user authentication.
